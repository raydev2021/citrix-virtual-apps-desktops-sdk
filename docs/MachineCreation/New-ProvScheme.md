## Detailed Description
Lets you create a new provisioning scheme. The creation process makes a copy of the hard disk attached to a virtual machine snapshot or VM template and stores it in every storage location that the hosting unit referenced by the provisioning scheme defines. This is a long-running task and typically takes several minutes to complete (depending on the size of the hard disk that is being copied and the number of snapshots that the hard disk consists of).

A snapshot or VM template must be used rather than a VM, so that the content of the hard disk for the provisioning scheme can be easily determined.

Because the snapshot or VM template are specified using a path into the Citrix Host Service PowerShell Provider, the Citrix Host Service PowerShell snap-in must also be loaded for this cmdlet to be used.

This cmdlet requires information to be provided that is retrieved using other snap-ins that form part of the Citrix Machine Creation Services: Hosting Unit Service Snapin The snap-in that provides information about the hypervisors. AD Identity Service Snapin The snap-in that provides information about the identity pools.

The provisioning scheme is a collection of all of the data that is required to form a template against which virtual machines can be created.  It therefore requires the following: Hosting Unit A reference to an item defined in the Host Service that defines the hypervisor, the network, and the storage to be used. Identity Pool A reference to the collection of Active Directory accounts that is used for virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme to be created.  This must be a name that is not being used by an existing provisioning scheme, and it must not contain any of the following characters \\/;:#.\*?=&lt;&gt;|\[\]()""' | true | false |  |

| AppScanResultsFile | File name to which the results of application scanning should be written. | false | false |  |
| MachineProfile | The inventory path to the source that is used as a template. This profile identifies the values for the VMs created by the catalog. This must be a path to an item in the same hosting unit that the hosting unit name or hosting unit UID refers to.  
Valid paths are of the format: XDHyp:\\HostingUnits\\&lt;HostingUnitName&gt;\\&lt;path&gt;\\&lt;VMName&gt;.vm | false | false |  |

| InitialBatchSizeHint | Provides a predictive hint for the number of initial VMs that will be added to the MCS catalog when the scheme is succesfully created. Callers should supply this parameter in situations where the completion of New-ProvScheme will be closely followed by a New-ProvVM call to create an initial batch of VMs in the catalog. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| TraceParent | Specifies the trace parent assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |
| TraceState | Specifies the trace state assigned for internal diagnostic tracing user | false | false |  |

    Error Codes  
    -----------  
    JobCreationFailed  
    The requested task could not be started.  
    DatabaseError  
    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.  
    DatabaseNotConfigured  
    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.  
    ServiceStatusInvalidDb  
    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed for  
    for various reasons.  
    MachineCreationServiceDoesNotSupportPersonalDisk  
    The service instance being used has not been upgraded to support the personal vDisk feature.  
    DatabaseMissingCapabilites  
    The database supporting the service instance being used has not been upgraded to support the personal vDisk feature.  
    CommunicationError  
    An error occurred while communicating with the service.  
    InvalidParameterCombination  
    Both PurgeJobOnSuccess and RunAsynchronously were specified. When running asynchronously, the cmdlet terminates before the job does, so it cannot clean up the completed job.  
    PermissionDenied  
    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.  
    ConfigurationLoggingError  
    The operation could not be performed because of a configuration logging error.  
    ScopeNotFound  
    One or more of the scopes nominated for the new provisioning scheme do not exist.  
    WorkflowHostUnavailable  
    The task could not be started because the database connection is inactive.  
    ExceptionThrown  
    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used, or examine the XenDesktop logs. VhdParametersMustBeSupplied  
    When parameter VhdTemplateSource or VhdResultDestination is supplied, both parameters are required to be supplied. ServiceDoesNotSupportFullDiskClone  
    The full disk clone parameter is being used when the service does not support the full disk clone feature. Upgrade the service or remove the parameter. FullDiskCloneDoesNotSupportCleanOnBootVMs  
    The full disk clone functionality is applicable to dedicated provisioned machines only. FullDiskCloneDoesNotSupportPvdVMs  
    The full disk clone functionality is only applicable to dedicated provisioned machines that do not use Personal VDisks.  
    The cmdlet is associated with a task of type NewProvisioningScheme, and while active will move through the following operations (CurrentOperation field)

### Example 3

```
C:\PS>$provScheme = New-ProvScheme -ProvisioningSchemeName XenPS2 -HostingUnitName XenHu -IdentityPoolName idPool1 -CleanOnBoot -MasterImageVM XDHyp:\HostingUnits\XenHU\Base.vm\Base.snapshot -UsePersonalVDiskStorage -PersonalVDiskDriveSize 17 -PersonalVDiskDriveLetter x
```

#### Description
Creates a new provisioning scheme with the name "XenPS2" using the hosting unit "XenHu" and the identity pool "idPool1" from the master VM snapshot called "Base.snapshot"; apply a 17GB personal vDisk. The personal vDisk is mapped as drive X. The operation runs synchronously, and the return value contains the task details  
For example:  
C:\\PS&gt;\$provScheme
