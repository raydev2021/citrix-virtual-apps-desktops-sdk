## Detailed Description
Lets you create new virtual machines with the configuration specified by a provisioning scheme.

The virtual machines are created using all of the storage specified in the provisioning scheme. The storage is used in a round robin mechanism. For the duration of this task, the AD accounts are locked (by the AD Identity Service), which stops the same accounts being used by other virtual machine creation tasks.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme in which the virtual machines are created. | true | false |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The unique identifier for the provisioning scheme in which the virtual machines are created. | true | false |  |
| ADAccountName | A list of the Active Directory account names that are used for the virtual machines. The accounts must be provided in a domain-qualified format. This parameter accepts Identity objects as returned by the New-AcctADAccount cmdlet, or any PSObject with string properties "Domain" and "ADAccountName". | true | false |  |
| FastBuild | Indicates whether or not the command can improve speed by using optimizations in the creation process. This may mean that machines you create cannot be booted until ResetVM operations have been performed by the Broker and Machine Identity Services. | false | false |  |
| NetworkMapping | Specifies how the attached NICs are mapped to networks. If this parameter is omitted, provisioned VMs are created with network settings as inherited from the provisioning scheme. If this parameter is supplied, machines are created with the number of NICs specified in the map, and each NIC is attached to the specified network. | false | false |  |
| AutoAssignVLAN | Indicates whether or not the VLAN of the network should be automatically assigned to the new VM or if the VLAN from the master image should be used | false | false | false |
| SecurityGroup | The security groups to apply to machines created in Cloud Hypervisors | false | false |  |
| MachinesPerAssistant | The number of concurrent volume operations that may be performed by each volume worker helper machine | false | false |  |
| MaxAssistants | The maximum number of volume worker help machines that may be created for this operation. | false | false |  |
| RunAsynchronously | Indicates whether or not the command returns before it is complete. If specified, the command returns an identifier for the task that was created. This task can be monitored using the get-ProvTask command. | false | false | false |
| PurgeJobOnSuccess | Indicates that the task history is removed from the database when the task has finished. This cannot be specified for tasks that are run asynchronously. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| TraceParent | Specifies the trace parent assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |
| TraceState | Specifies the trace state assigned for internal diagnostic tracing user | false | false |  |
| VirtualSiteId | Specifies the virtual site the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller to which the PowerShell snap-in connects. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Notes
Only one long-running task in each provisioning scheme can be processed at a time.  
    In the case of failure, the following errors can result.  
    Error Codes  
    -----------  
    JobCreationFailed  
    The requested task could not be started.  
    DatabaseError  
    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.  
    DatabaseNotConfigured  
    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.  
    ServiceStatusInvalidDb  
    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed  
    for various reasons.  
    WorkflowHostUnavailable  
    The task could not be started because the database connection is inactive.  
    PermissionDenied  
    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.  
    ConfigurationLoggingError  
    The operation could not be performed because of a configuration logging error  
    CommunicationError  
    An error occurred while communicating with the service.  
    InvalidParameterCombination  
    Both PurgeJobOnSuccess and RunAsynchronously were specified.  
    When running asynchronously, the cmdlet terminates before the job does,  
    so it cannot clean up the completed job.  
    PermissionDenied  
    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.  
    ExceptionThrown  
    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs  
    on the controller being used, or examine the XenDesktop logs.  
    The cmdlet is associated with a task of type NewVirtualMachine, and while active will move through the following operations (CurrentOperation field)  
    ValidatingInputs  
    CreatingVirtualMachines  
    ReleasingAccountLocks
