| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ServiceHostId | Id of the Service | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| InputObject | Objects to which metadata is to be removed. | true | true (ByValue) |  |

The properties whose names match keys in the map will be removed. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations.

| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| TraceParent | Specifies the trace parent assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
