Removes an App-V package from the library that is holding it
## Syntax

```
Remove-AppLibAppVPackage [-Uid] <Int32> [-ServerUid <Int32>] [-Purge <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-TraceParent <String>] [-TraceState <String>] [-VirtualSiteId <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to remove an App-V package from the application library.

Removing a package from the library optionally only marks it as not existing. In this case, re-adding the package later will restore the reference.

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |

| Uid | The App Library's internal unique identifier of the App-V package. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| ServerUid | Unique Identifier for AppVServer. | false | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| Purge | Indicates whether the package should be removed from the database. The default is true.

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| TraceParent | Specifies the trace parent assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |
| TraceState | Specifies the trace state assigned for internal diagnostic tracing use | false | false |  |

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
