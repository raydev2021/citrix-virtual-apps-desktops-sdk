## Detailed Description
Reads a specific UniversalClaim by Claim or VirtualSid, or enumerates UniversalClaims by passing nothing.


### Brokeruniversalclaim Object
A UniversalClaim object stores the mapping between a Claim and a VirtualSID. A claim can be an arbitrary string up to 450 characters in length. Each Claim is mapped to a Virtual SID.  Virtual SIDs are generated by either taking a SHA256 hash of the claim, and storing the hash bytes in a SID format, or in the case of a SID string being used as a Claim, the SID is copied to the VirtualSid.


  * Claim (System.String) The Claim for this UniversalClaim mapping

  * DirectoryContext (System.String) The DirectoryContext associated with this UniversalClaim mapping

  * UniversalClaimsTenantContext (System.String) The UniversalClaimsTenantContext associated with this UniversalClaim mapping

  * VirtualSid (System.String) The VirtualSid for this UniversalClaim mapping

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claim | The Claim for this UniversalClaim mapping | true | false |  |
| VirtualSid | The VirtualSid for this UniversalClaim mapping. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available. This error record is additional information and does not affect the objects written to the output pipeline. See [about\_Broker\_Filtering](../about_Broker_Filtering/) for details. | false | false | False |
| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |

| FilterScope | Gets only results allowed by the specified scope id. | false | false |  |

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
