Remove a GPO blob.
## Syntax

```
Remove-BrokerGpoBlob [-InputObject] <GpoBlob[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-TraceParent <String>] [-TraceState <String>] [-VirtualSiteId <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
Remove a GPO blob. If the blob is the default site blob, its policies are removed and the settings and filters defined for the policies are also removed. But the blob itself cannot be removed. Removing the default site blob is equivalent to erasing all the data in the site blob. If the blob is not the default site blob, the blob and the policies, settings, and filters defined for those policies are also used. The blob entry is also removed.
