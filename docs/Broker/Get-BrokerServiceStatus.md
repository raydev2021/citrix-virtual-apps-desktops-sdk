## Syntax

Get-BrokerServiceStatus [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-TraceParent <String>] [-TraceState <String>] [-VirtualSiteId <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
Enables the status of the Broker Service on the controller to be determined. If the service has multiple data stores it will return the overall state as an aggregate of all the data store states.

Before using this command, you don't have to configure the database connection to the Service.

The Get-BrokerServiceStatus command returns an object containing the status of the Broker Service together with extra diagnostics information.  
DBUnconfigured  
    The Broker Service does not have a database connection configured.  
DBRejectedConnection  
    The database rejected the logon attempt from the Broker Service.  This may be because the service attempted to log on with invalid credentials or because a database has not been installed in the specified location.  
InvalidDBConfigured  
    The expected stored procedures are missing from the database. This may be because the Broker Service schema has not been added to the database.  
DBNotFound  
    The specified database could not be located with the configured connection string.  
DBMissingOptionalFeature  
    The Broker is connected to a database that is valid, but it does not have the full functionality required for optimal performance. Upgrading the database is advisable.  
DBMissingMandatoryFeature  
    The Broker is connected to a database that is valid, but it does not have the full functionality required so the Broker cannot function. Upgrading the database is required.  
DBNewerVersionThanService  
    The version of the Broker Service currently in use is incompatible with the version of the Broker Service schema on the database.  Upgrade the Broker Service to a more recent version.  
DBOlderVersionThanService  
    The version of the Broker Service schema on the database is incompatible with the version of the Broker Service currently in use.  Upgrade the database schema to a more recent version.

OK  
    The Broker Service is running and is connected to a database containing a valid schema.  
PendingFailure  
    Connectivity between the Broker Service and the database has been lost. This may be a transitory network error, but may indicate a loss of connectivity that requires administrator intervention.  
Failed  
    Connectivity between the Broker and the database has been lost for an extended period of time, or has failed due to a configuration problem. The Broker service cannot operate while its connection to the database is unavailable.  
Unknown  
    The service status cannot be determined.
