See [about\_Broker\_Filtering](../about_Broker_Filtering/) for information about advanced filtering options.


### Brokercatalog Object
The catalog object returned represents a group of related physical or virtual machines that have been configured in the site.

See [about\_Broker\_Machines](../about_Broker_Machines/) for more information.


  * AdminFolderName (System.String) The name of the admin folder the catalog is in (including trailing backslash), or the empty string if the catalog is at the root level

  * AdminFolderUid (System.Int32) The Uid of the admin folder the catalog is in (if any)

  * AllocationType (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.AllocationType) Denotes how the the machines in the catalog are allocated to a user. Possible values are:
    * Static: Machines get assigned to a user either by the admin or on first use. This relationship is static and changes only if an admin explicitly changes the assignments.
    * Random: Machines are allocated to users randomly from a pool of available machines.

  * AppDnaAnalysisState (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.AppDnaAnalysisState?) The AppDNA Analysis State of the catalog

  * AssignedCount (System.Int32) The number of assigned machines (machines that have been assigned to a user/users or a client name/address).

  * AvailableAssignedCount (System.Int32) The number of available machines (not in a desktop group), that are also assigned to users.

  * AvailableCount (System.Int32) The number of available machines (those not in any desktop group).

  * AvailableUnassignedCount (System.Int32) The number of available machines (those not in any desktop group) that are not assigned to users.

  * CatalogName (System.String) Name of the catalog (must be unique within a Folder)

  * Description (System.String) Description of the catalog.

  * HypervisorConnectionUid (System.Int32?) The Uid of the hypervisor connection that is associated with the machines in the catalog. This property only applies to MCS provisioned catalogs. For other provisioning types machines can be from one or more different hypervisor connections.

  * IsRemotePC (System.Boolean) Specifies whether or not the catalog is a RemotePC catalog. Remote PC catalogs automatically configure appropriate machines without the need for manual configuration. See [about\_Broker\_RemotePC](../about_Broker_RemotePC/) for more information.

  * MachinesArePhysical (System.Boolean) Specifies whether or not the machines in the catalog can be power-managed by the broker.

  * MetadataMap (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;) Holds any metadata associated with the catalog.

  * MinimumFunctionalLevel (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.FunctionalLevel) The expected minimal functional level of the machines in the catalog.

  * Name (System.String) Name of the catalog.

  * PersistUserChanges (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.PersistUserChanges) Specifies how user changes are persisted on machines in the catalog. Possible values are:
    * OnLocal: User changes are stored on the machine's local storage.
    * Discard: User changes are discarded.

  * ProvisioningSchemeId (System.Guid?) The GUID of the provisioning scheme (if any) associated with the catalog. This only applies if the provisioning type is MCS.

  * ProvisioningType (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ProvisioningType) Specifies how the machines are provisioned in the catalog. Possible values are:
    * Manual: No provisioning.
    * PVS: Machine provisioned by PVS (machine may be physical, blade, VM...)
    * MCS: Machine provisioned by MCS (machine must be a VM).

  * PvsAddress (System.String) IP address of the PVS server to be used in a catalog with a PVS ProvisioningType.

  * PvsDomain (System.String) The domain of the PVS server to be used in a catalog with a PVS ProvisioningType.

  * RemotePCDesktopGroupPriorities (System.Int32\[\]) Remote PC desktop groups' association priorities.

  * RemotePCDesktopGroupUids (System.Int32\[\]) UIDs of the Remote PC desktop groups associated with this catalog.

  * RemotePCHypervisorConnectionUid (System.Int32?) UID of the hypervisor connection used for powering on RemotePC machines in this catalog (only for catalogs with IsRemotePC set to true).

  * Scopes (Citrix.Fma.Sdk.DelegatedAdminInterfaces.ScopeReference\[\]) The list of the delegated admin scopes to which the catalog belongs.

  * SessionSupport (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SessionSupport) Specifies the session support of the machines in the catalog. Valid values are: SingleSession, MultiSession.

  * Tags (System.String\[\]) Tags associated with the catalog.

  * TenantId (System.Guid?) Identity of tenant associated with catalog. Not applicable (always blank) in non-multitenant sites.
