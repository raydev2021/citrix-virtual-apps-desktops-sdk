## Detailed Description
The New-BrokerDesktopGroup cmdlet creates a new broker desktop group that can then be used to manage the brokering settings of all desktops within that desktop group. Once the desktop group has been created, you can create desktops in it by adding the appropriate broker machines to it using the Add-BrokerMachine or Add-BrokerMachinesToDesktopGroup cmdlets.

Desktop groups hold settings that apply to all desktops they contain.

For any automatic power management settings of a desktop group to take effect, the group's TimeZone property must be specified. Automatic power management operations include pool management (power time schemes), reboot schedules, session disconnect and logoff actions, and powering on assigned machines etc.

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations.

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
