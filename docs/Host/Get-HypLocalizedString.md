#### Description
This command illustrates how a single error/exception message can be obtained for a hosting operation that failed (such as a provisioning operation). The caller specifies that they need to display the message in the en-US locale. They also specify a lookup key or message ID for the message, which will have been obtained as an exception code from the failed operation. The locale and key/ID are traded for a readable message, which also includes substitutions.
